# Escudo: RP Roleplay
I created this gamemode back in 2013 before I started College. I unfortunately never completed it due to college taking up most of my time back then. I was scratching through my project folders and found this gamemode script I was developing for my own Roleplay server back in the day. It took me about 9 months to code this after following tutorials and youtube videos to learn code even the most basic of commands. I mainly coded this because I wanted to develop my own server because I thought the others wernt developed how I thought they should be. This was the start of my developing career.

Im not sure how valid this code is still today, but I have come back to release this code to potentially help others get somewhere with their code. This project has 10 931 lines of code so its alot of examples to take and use for what you need.

All I ask is if you please leave credit where credit is due.

# Features
The server has a saving and loading system using MySQL. Players can buy skins, buy vehicles, buy houses, work jobs to earn a income. There is a advanced admin system linked to the database so you can make vehicle dealerships and houses without needing to go into the database.


### Vehicle System
Admins can create cars for sale at the car dealership and players can buy the vehicles and park them at their houses. Players vehicles have fuel and can run out of fuel.

### House System
Admins can create houses for sale around the map and select the price and what interior the houses uses. Players can buy houses and enter them, each house has its own Virtual World.

### Factions System
LAPD officers can patrol the city in police cruisers and police bikes. They have the most advanced faction system because they have the arresting system and a prison system that teleports and jails the suspect to a custom made prison map.

LAFMD get called to players that get knocked out or call 911. They need to respond to the calls and race out to the injured to transport them to the hospital
